# differential-equation-solver-python
python numerical nth order linear and nonlinear differential equation solver package
# Notes:
## * **numSolveDQ** is the package that contains the code that numerically solves differential equations
## To understand how to input differential equations:
* run and read the interactive demo program, which guides the user in solving a differential equation, to see how the package can be implemented
* run and read the **test_case** programs to understand syntax and how the package can be implemented
* read the comments in **numSolveDQ/modules/dqsolve.py** to understand how to input differential equations
