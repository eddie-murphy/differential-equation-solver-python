# differential-equation-solver-python
python numerical nth order linear and nonlinear differential equation solver package
# Notes:
## * **numSolveDQ** is the package that contains the code that numerical solves differential eqiations
## To understand how to input differential equations:
* run the interactive demo program which guides the user in solving a differential equation
  * it uses the package so the syntax it asks for in user input is the syntax the package uses
* run and read the **test_case** programs to understand syntax
* read the comments in **numSolveDQ/modules/dqsolve.py** to understand how to input differential equations
